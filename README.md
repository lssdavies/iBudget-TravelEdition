## Description

Budgeting app with offline and PWA functionality built in. The app gives a graphical representation of a users spending over time.
The motivation behind this app was to provide users with the ability to track their spending while on vacation. I also wanted to provide a solution that provided offline functionality and make it available for download on mobile.
I built the app with my own needs in mind, I find it difficult to keep track of my spending when on vacation and most solutions require some sort of internet connection. Access to the internet when travelling can be a challenge so I wanted to provide a solution that would have offline functionality and be installable on mobile.
